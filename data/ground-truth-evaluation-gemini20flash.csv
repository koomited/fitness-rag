",PARTIALLY_RELEVANT,"The answer is a valid response based on the premise that only the information provided should be considered. However, it fails to acknowledge that other muscles are indeed involved in a Sumo Squat, even if not as primarily as the three mentioned.  A better answer would acknowledge the limitations of the information provided and mention the likely involvement of other muscles, such as adductors, calves, and core muscles.","Besides the Quadriceps, Glutes, and Hamstrings, are there any other secondary muscle groups significantly engaged during a Sumo Squat?"
176,"Based on the provided context, no other muscles besides rectus abdominis and hip flexors are listed as being engaged during reverse crunches.
",PARTIALLY_RELEVANT,"The answer is partially relevant because it correctly states that, based on the *provided context* (which is missing), only rectus abdominis and hip flexors are listed. However, it fails to acknowledge that other muscles are likely involved even if not explicitly mentioned in a particular source.  A more complete answer would acknowledge that other core muscles like obliques and transverse abdominis are likely involved to some degree, even if their contribution is secondary.","Besides rectus abdominis and hip flexors, what other muscles are secondarily engaged during reverse crunches?"
74,"The provided instructions for the Cable Bicep Curl are: Stand facing a cable machine with the handle attached to a low pulley. Curl the handle towards your shoulders, then lower it back down. The instructions do not mention leaning back.
",PARTIALLY_RELEVANT,"The answer correctly states that the standard instructions don't mention leaning back. However, it doesn't address the core question of whether leaning back slightly to increase range of motion is acceptable.  It only provides a description of the exercise, not an evaluation of the proposed modification.",Is it okay to slightly lean back during the Cable Bicep Curl movement to increase the range of motion?
94,"I am unable to provide the recommended repetitions, sets, or frequency for TRX Push-Ups. The provided context includes instructions on how to perform the exercise, but does not include information on the recommended repetitions, sets, or frequency.
",PARTIALLY_RELEVANT,"The answer correctly identifies that it cannot provide the requested information due to lack of context.  However, it would be more helpful if it suggested alternative resources or general guidelines for beginner exercise programming (e.g., starting with lower reps and sets and gradually increasing).","How many repetitions and sets of TRX push-ups should I aim for as a beginner, and how frequently should I perform this exercise?"
65,"I am sorry, the provided text does not include information about modifications to the ab wheel rollout for those lacking sufficient core strength.
",NON_RELEVANT,"The answer is a canned response indicating a lack of information.  It doesn't attempt to answer the question or provide alternative resources.  A better response would suggest modifications (e.g., using a wall for support, doing knee rollouts instead) or acknowledge the limitations and direct the user to seek professional advice.",What modifications can I make to the ab wheel rollout if I lack sufficient core strength?
93,"The Single-Leg Glute Bridge activates the Glutes. It does not specify that it isolates one glute, but it does activate the glutes muscle group.
",PARTIALLY_RELEVANT,"The answer correctly states that the Single-Leg Glute Bridge activates the glutes. However, it doesn't directly address whether it primarily works one glute at a time or engages the opposite glute muscle, which is the core of the question.  The answer is too vague to be considered fully relevant.","Does the Single-Leg Glute Bridge primarily work one glute at a time, or does it also engage the opposite glute muscle?"
9,"Yes, Jumping Squats are a variation of Jumping Jacks. Jumping Squats target the Quadriceps, Glutes, and Calves. Jumping Jacks target the Calves, Deltoids, and Glutes. Therefore, Jumping Squats target specific muscle groups more effectively than Jumping Jacks.
",PARTIALLY_RELEVANT,"The answer correctly identifies a variation of jumping jacks (jumping squats) and mentions the muscles targeted by each exercise. However, it oversimplifies the comparison by only focusing on two exercises and doesn't explore the broader range of jumping jack variations to target specific muscle groups more effectively.  A more comprehensive answer would explore other variations and provide a more nuanced comparison.",Are there variations of jumping jacks to target specific muscle groups more effectively?
188,"I cannot answer this question. The provided context does not contain information about grip width for the Smith Machine Incline Press.
",NON_RELEVANT,"While the answer is honest in stating it cannot answer the question, it doesn't provide any helpful information or alternative resources.  A better response would acknowledge the question and suggest alternative sources of information, such as fitness websites or expert opinions.","Should I use a narrow or wide grip when performing the Smith Machine Incline Press, and why?"
120,"The provided text doesn't include instructions on seat height adjustment for the Machine Shoulder Press.
",NON_RELEVANT,The answer is a canned response indicating a lack of information in a source text that wasn't provided.  It doesn't actually address the question of whether or not seat height adjustment is important for proper form and injury prevention on a machine shoulder press.,Should I adjust the seat height on the Machine Shoulder Press to ensure proper form and prevent injury?
